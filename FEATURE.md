<h2> FEATURE </h2>.
Our game is 4x4. We modified the grid code and modified the success condition code according to the number of changes. Also, this game is comfortable because of its big size and font. In our game, you can see who is next. On the right side of the game board, it is marked "x" for "x" and "o" for "o". Also, it is feature by being turned off immediately after the game is over. We changed the variable named ‘count’ that was 0, to 1 when the result of the game came out. And at the end, we added a code to end the game if 'count' is 1. Finally, the background was inserted. We defined and loaded the location of the image folder.
